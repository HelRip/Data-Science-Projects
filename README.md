# Welcome to my GitHub!

Here you'll find a collection of my most sharable and impactful projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in machine learning and data science. 

Below are detailed descriptions of two key projects I've recently worked on.

I have more projects and continually work on new and exciting challenges, so stay tuned for updates!

## Projects

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive comparison of various machine learning models to detect anomalies in credit card transactions, focusing on identifying fraudulent activities.

**Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-nearest neighbors (kNN)
- XGBoost

**Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms:**
- One-Class SVM
- Local Outlier Factor
- DBSCAN
- Isolation Forest
- K-Means Clustering

**Neural Network:**
- Sequential Neural Network

This project involved rigorous testing and evaluation to determine the most effective model for fraud detection, providing valuable insights into model performance and anomaly detection techniques.

### Contradictory, My Dear Watson
*Kaggle Competition*

This project is part of a Kaggle competition aimed at classifying pairs of sentences into three categories: entailment, neutral, or contradiction. The dataset includes hypotheses, premises, and labels, spanning 14 different languages.

**Achievements:**
- Ranked 17th on the competition leaderboard.
- Experimented with various BERT models to improve classification accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
- BERT
- Encoders
- Additional natural language processing techniques
